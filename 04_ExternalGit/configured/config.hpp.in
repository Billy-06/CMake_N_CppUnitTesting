// significant breaking changes in the code to the extent that if
// a user were to compile the code on the previous version, it wouldn't work
// >    Minor: This indicates that th new version contains some new features
// but previous versions compile just fine
// >    Patch: This shows that there are no new features in the new version
// and the previous versions would compile just fine, but there has been bug
// fixes to the new version
